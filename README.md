# enode-docker

## Overview

This is a containerized environment for running an application stack with an NGINX reverse proxy, a Python backend, and a MySQL database using Docker Compose. This project provides a production-ready containerized setup for deploying a Python application behind an NGINX reverse proxy, with a MySQL database for persistent storage.

## Architecture

**Services:**

1. **Reverse Proxy (NGINX)**  
- Builds from: `./nginx/.`  
- Exposes port `443`  
- Handles HTTPS and routes traffic to the app.  
- Static IP: `192.168.1.10`

2. **Application (Python)**  
- Builds from: `./python/.`  
- Uses `.env` in `./python/` for configuration  
- Static IP: `192.168.1.15`

3Ô∏è. **Database (MySQL)**  
- Image: `mysql:8.0`  
- Data persisted at `./db/enodedata/`  
- Uses `.env` in `./db/` for credentials/config  
- Exposes port `3306`  
- Static IP: `192.168.1.20`

All services run on a custom bridge network `enodenet` with subnet `192.168.1.0/24`.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) / [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- Webhook - Can be created via [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)
- Public DNS Name - Can be requested via [No-IP](https://www.noip.com/)
- Certbot
- Open ports `443` and `3306` on your host machine

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

1. **Clone the repo:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jvieira9/enode-docker.git
   cd enode-docker
   ```
2. **Obtain DNS Name:**

- Associate your host machine's IP address to a DNS Name, this can be done via [No-IP](https://www.noip.com/)

3. **Generate certificate:**

- You can generate your certificate via Certbot:

Before executing the next commands, your host machine and NGINX container need to have port 80 open, so that Certbot can check the website's existence. The port can be closed after the process is complete.

```bash
sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx
sudo certbot --nginx
```

4. **Create webhook:**

- Install the [ENODE API Postman Collection](https://enode-api.production.enode.io/postman/latest.json) and create a webhook

4. **Create .env files:**

- Modify the two .env files with your data

- Example of ./python/.env ‚Äî for your Python app‚Äôs environment variables:

```.env
DB_HOST=your_db_user_ip
DB_USER=your_db_user
DB_PASS=your_db_password
DB_NAME=your_db_name

ENODE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret
ENODE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
ENODE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
```

- Example of ./db/.env ‚Äî for MySQL root password, database name, user, etc.

```.env
**Example `db/.env`:**

```env
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=your_root_password
MYSQL_DATABASE=your_db_name
MYSQL_USER=your_db_user
MYSQL_PASSWORD=your_db_password
```
## üöÄ Usage

1. Build and start all services:

``` bash
docker-compose up --build -d
```
2. Stop and remove containers:
```bash
docker-compose down
``` 
## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
- NGINX:
Place your custom NGINX configuration files in ./nginx/. Make sure your Dockerfile in that folder copies them correctly.

### Python App:
Your application code and dependencies should live in ./python/. Update your Dockerfile there to install dependencies and run the app properly.

Database:
The MySQL database stores its data persistently in ./db/jvdatamysql/. This means your data won‚Äôt be lost when containers are stopped or rebuilt.
